# ucKanren

## What are we looking to do?

Well, I'd like to start from scratch. Take the microKanren represented
in the ICFP paper (which can be found at: https://github.com/jasonhemann/microKanren) and extend it. 

## What do we need to to?

* Implement cells.
* p-array, union-find
* generalized unification constraint

## Relevant Questions

* What is a cell?
* * Is it a variable?
* * Is it a root in the union-find graph?
* What is the difference between unify and ==?
